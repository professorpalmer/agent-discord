# Changelog

## 0.5.5

Reply-first job threads, persist-then-settle, and host GitHub auth.

- New channel asks open a Discord thread on the user message and post the live card ("On it.") before the worker starts.
- Token flushes edit that one card. Meaningful beats settle as normal thread messages so history survives edits.
- In-thread follow-ups stay in the same thread (steer) and keep thread history.
- Worker monologue and host-reach / `gh auth login` dumps never reach Discord.
- `discord-os add github` writes `GH_TOKEN` into the host `.env`. Workers inherit host PATH + tokens.
- Unauthenticated `gh` paints a one-line how-to and Done. No worker essay.
- HOST card shows a github row (ok / sign-in). More includes GitHub.
